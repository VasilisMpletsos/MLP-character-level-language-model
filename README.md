Character level language model build with a simple Multi Layer Perceptron.

## ðŸš€ About This Project

This implementation follows Andrej Karpathyâ€™s tutorial of `makemore` and the Bengio et. al. paper `A Neural Probabilistic Language Model` ([Youtube Link](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore) , [Paper Link](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf)) on building a character language model
from ground up.

Andrej lecture provides a step by step walkthrough of implementing a character level language model using a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), inspired by Bengio et al. (2003). It starts with an introduction and a review of the foundational paper, then covers the process of building a training dataset suitable for character-level modeling.
